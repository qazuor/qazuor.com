# Container Queries

**The problem:** You have a card component that needs different layouts at different sizes. Media queries look at the viewport, but your card might be in a sidebar or full-width section.

## The Solution

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

.card {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
}

@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;
  }
}
```

## Why Not Media Queries?

Media queries respond to the **viewport**. Container queries respond to the **parent container**. This means your component adapts to where it's placed, not the screen size.

## Quick Tip

Use `container-type: inline-size` for width-based queries. The `size` value also tracks height but has more performance overhead.
