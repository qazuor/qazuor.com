# Planning Sessions

This directory stores planning sessions for features and major changes.

## Structure

Each planning session follows this structure:

```
P-XXX-feature-name/
├── PDR.md                 # Product Design Requirements
├── tech-analysis.md       # Technical Analysis
├── TODOs.md              # Task breakdown
└── issues-sync.json      # GitHub sync metadata (optional)
```

## Workflow

1. Start planning: `/start-feature-plan`
2. Review and approve planning docs
3. Implement tasks from TODOs.md
4. Archive session when complete

## Archive

Completed sessions are moved to `archived/YYYY/MM/` for reference.
