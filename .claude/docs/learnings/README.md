# Learnings Archive

Documented learnings and best practices discovered during Hospeda development.

---

## Purpose

This directory contains individual learning files extracted from CLAUDE.md's
"Recent Learnings" section. Each learning is documented with:

- **Title**: Clear, descriptive name
- **Date**: When the learning was discovered/documented
- **Category**: Classification (e.g., Testing, Architecture, DevOps)
- **Problem**: What issue prompted this learning
- **Solution**: How to handle/solve the problem
- **Impact**: Severity, frequency, scope, prevention
- **Related**: Links to documentation and related learnings

---

## Structure

Each learning is a standalone markdown file with kebab-case naming:

```
learnings/
├── README.md (this file)
├── shell-compatibility-fish.md
├── monorepo-command-execution.md
├── test-organization-structure.md
├── markdown-formatting-standards.md
├── planning-linear-sync-workflow.md

## Available Learnings

### Shell & Terminal (1)

**[shell-compatibility-fish.md](shell-compatibility-fish.md)**

- **Category:** Shell / Terminal / DevOps
- **Problem:** `for` loops hang Fish shell
- **Solution:** Use `find -exec` or `xargs` alternatives
- **Impact:** High severity, blocks workflow
- **Date:** 2024-10-28

### Monorepo & Build (1)

**[monorepo-command-execution.md](monorepo-command-execution.md)**

- **Category:** Monorepo / PNPM / Development
- **Problem:** Incorrect command execution in monorepo packages
- **Solution:** Always use `cd packageName && pnpm run <command>`
- **Impact:** High severity, causes build failures
- **Date:** 2024-10-28

### Testing (1)

**[test-organization-structure.md](test-organization-structure.md)**

- **Category:** Testing / Project Structure
- **Problem:** Tests in wrong locations cause import/build issues
- **Solution:** Use `test/` folder, mirror `src/` structure
- **Impact:** Medium severity, affects reliability
- **Date:** 2024-10-28

### Documentation (1)

**[markdown-formatting-standards.md](markdown-formatting-standards.md)**

- **Category:** Documentation / Formatting
- **Problem:** Inconsistent markdown fails CI/CD checks
- **Solution:** Run `pnpm format:md` before commits
- **Impact:** Medium severity, blocks CI/CD
- **Date:** 2024-10-28

### Planning & Workflow (1)

**[planning-linear-sync-workflow.md](planning-linear-sync-workflow.md)**

- **Category:** Planning / GitHub / Linear / Workflow
- **Problem:** Manual planning sync loses context
- **Solution:** Sync after approval, commit before completion
- **Impact:** High severity, affects tracking
- **Date:** 2024-10-28

### Architecture & Patterns (2)

**[common-architectural-patterns.md](common-architectural-patterns.md)**

- **Category:** Architecture / Best Practices
- **Problem:** Inconsistent patterns across codebase
- **Solution:** Always use factories, base classes, RO-RO pattern
- **Impact:** High severity, affects maintainability
- **Date:** 2024-10-28

**[common-mistakes-to-avoid.md](common-mistakes-to-avoid.md)**

- **Category:** Best Practices / Code Quality
- **Problem:** Repeated mistakes slow development
- **Solution:** Never use `any`, default exports, skip tests, etc.
- **Impact:** High severity, compounds over time
- **Date:** 2024-10-28

### Optimization (1)

**[optimization-tips.md](optimization-tips.md)**

- **Category:** Performance / Best Practices
- **Problem:** Inefficient development practices
- **Solution:** Use Context7, dependency mapper, batch changes
- **Impact:** Medium severity, improves efficiency
- **Date:** 2024-10-28

## Usage

### For Claude

**Latest 10 learnings stay inline in CLAUDE.md** for quick reference.

When adding new learnings:

1. Add to CLAUDE.md "Recent Learnings" section (inline)
2. Create individual file in `.claude/docs/learnings/`
3. If > 10 learnings in CLAUDE.md, move oldest to "Archived Learnings" section
   (keep file)

**Finding learnings:**

- Check CLAUDE.md for latest 10 (quick reference)
- Check this directory for full archive (detailed information)

### For Developers

**When encountering errors or discovering patterns:**

1. Document immediately in CLAUDE.md "Recent Learnings"
2. Create detailed file in this directory
3. Include problem, solution, impact, related links

**When looking for solutions:**

1. Check CLAUDE.md first (latest 10 learnings)
2. Search this directory by category
3. Review related learnings for context
