/**
 * CalloutEnhancer - Transforms blockquotes with GitHub Alerts syntax into styled callouts
 *
 * Uses standard GitHub Alerts syntax (also used by Obsidian):
 * > [!NOTE]
 * > Useful information that users should know.
 *
 * > [!TIP]
 * > Helpful advice for doing things better.
 *
 * > [!WARNING]
 * > Urgent info that needs immediate attention.
 *
 * Supported types:
 * - GitHub standard: NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, WARNING, CAUTION
 * - Custom additions: INFO, SUCCESS, ERROR, QUOTE
 *
 * Type mapping:
 * - NOTE, INFO → callout-info
 * - TIP → callout-tip
 * - IMPORTANT, WARNING → callout-warning
 * - CAUTION, ERROR → callout-error
 * - SUCCESS → callout-success
 * - QUOTE → callout-quote
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This component should be included in the BaseLayout to ensure
 * the script is always present and can handle View Transitions navigation.
 * The bundled script runs once and registers a persistent event listener.
