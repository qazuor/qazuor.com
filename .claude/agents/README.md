# Hospeda Project - AI Agents

This directory contains **14 specialized AI agents** for the Hospeda tourism
platform. Each agent is an expert in specific areas and can be invoked during
development workflow.

> **Note**: Security and performance audits are handled via specialized skills
> (security-audit, performance-audit, accessibility-audit) coordinated by
> tech-lead rather than dedicated agents. This provides lightweight, reusable
> audit capabilities without full agent overhead.

## Agent Organization

Agents are organized into the following categories:

### Product & Planning (2 agents)

- **[product-functional](product/product-functional.md)** - Creates Product
  Design Requirements (PDRs) with user stories, acceptance criteria, mockups,
  and functional specifications during Phase 1 Planning
- **[product-technical](product/product-technical.md)** - Performs technical
  analysis, architecture design, creates tech-analysis.md with implementation
  plans during Phase 1 Planning

### Technical Leadership (1 agent)

- **[tech-lead](engineering/tech-lead.md)** - Provides architectural oversight,
  coordinates technical decisions, ensures code quality standards, manages
  CI/CD, and oversees deployments across all phases. Coordinates security and
  performance audits via specialized skills.

### Backend Development (3 agents)

- **[hono-engineer](engineering/hono-engineer.md)** - Designs and implements API
  routes, middleware, and server-side logic using Hono framework during Phase 2
  Implementation
- **[db-drizzle-engineer](engineering/db-drizzle-engineer.md)** - Designs and
  implements database schemas, manages migrations, and builds Drizzle models
  during Phase 2 Implementation
- **[node-typescript-engineer](engineering/node-typescript-engineer.md)** -
  Designs and implements generic shared packages (utils, logger, config, etc.)
  with Node.js and TypeScript best practices during Phase 2 Implementation

### Frontend Development (3 agents)

- **[astro-engineer](engineering/astro-engineer.md)** - Designs and implements
  public web app using Astro with React islands, SSR, and static generation
  during Phase 2 Implementation
- **[react-senior-dev](engineering/react-senior-dev.md)** - Builds reusable
  React 19 components with hooks and state management for Astro and TanStack
  Start during Phase 2 Implementation
- **[tanstack-start-engineer](engineering/tanstack-start-engineer.md)** -
  Implements admin dashboard with TanStack Start, Router, Query, and Form for
  type-safe development during Phase 2 Implementation

### Design & UX (2 agents)

- **[ux-ui-designer](design/ux-ui-designer.md)** - Designs user interfaces,
  creates user flows, ensures accessibility, and validates design standards
  during Phase 1 and Phase 3
- **[content-writer](design/content-writer.md)** - Creates engaging, bilingual
  (English/Spanish) web content with a friendly yet professional tone for
  customer-facing pages during content creation phases

### Quality Assurance (2 agents)

- **[qa-engineer](quality/qa-engineer.md)** - Ensures quality through testing,
  validates acceptance criteria, and verifies features meet standards during
  Phase 3 Validation
- **[debugger](quality/debugger.md)** - Investigates bugs, diagnoses issues,
  identifies root causes, and proposes fixes using systematic debugging during
  Phase 3 and issue resolution

### Specialized (4 agents)

- **[tech-writer](specialized/tech-writer.md)** - Creates comprehensive
  documentation for code, APIs, architecture, processes, manages dependency
  tracking and updates, and generates changelogs following Keep a Changelog
  format during Phase 4 Finalization and all phases
- **[i18n-specialist](specialized/i18n-specialist.md)** - Designs and maintains
  internationalization system, manages translations, and ensures multi-language
  support during all phases
- **[enrichment-agent](specialized/enrichment-agent.md)** - Analyzes planning
  sessions and enriches GitHub issues with relevant planning context, technical
  decisions, and task relationships during planning sync and issue creation
- **[seo-ai-specialist](specialized/seo-ai-specialist.md)** - Optimizes web
  presence for traditional search engines and AI-powered search through
  technical SEO, Core Web Vitals, structured data, and LLM-readiness strategies
  during all phases

## Usage

Agents are automatically available to Claude Code. They are invoked using the
Task tool during the development workflow:

```text
Use the Task tool with subagent_type="agent-name"
```

**Example invocations:**

```text
"Invoke the product-functional agent to create the PDR"
"Use the tech-lead agent to review architectural decisions"
"Call the db-drizzle-engineer to design the database schema"
"Invoke the qa-engineer to validate test coverage"
```

## Agent File Format

Each agent file must include:

1. **YAML Frontmatter** with:
   - `name`: Unique identifier (lowercase with hyphens)
   - `description`: When the agent should be invoked
   - `tools`: (Optional) Comma-separated list of allowed tools
   - `model`: (Optional) sonnet/opus/haiku/inherit
   - `responsibilities`: (Optional) List of key responsibilities

2. **System Prompt** defining:
   - Role and responsibilities
   - Working context
   - Best practices
   - Quality checklists
   - Workflow integration

## Contributing

When adding new agents:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate category subfolder
2. Follow the naming convention: `kebab-case-name.md`
3. Include proper YAML frontmatter with all required fields
4. Write comprehensive system prompt with:
   - Clear role definition
   - Specific responsibilities
