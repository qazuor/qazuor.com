# Git Commit Helper Skill

## Purpose

Generate conventional commit messages that follow the project's commit
standards, analyze changed files, group changes logically, and format copy-paste
ready git commands for efficient version control workflow.

---

## Capabilities

- Group changes logically by feature/type
- Generate commit messages per `commitlint.config.js`
- Format copy-paste ready commands
- Ensure semantic versioning compatibility
- Follow conventional commits standard
- Suggest appropriate commit types and scopes

---

## Commit Message Guidelines

### Subject Line

** GOOD:**

```text
feat(search): add full-text search
fix(pricing): handle zero price edge case
refactor(models): simplify BaseModel interface
```text

**L BAD:**

```text
feat: added some search stuff
FIX - pricing bug
Refactoring
```text

**Rules:**

- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- Don't capitalize first letter
- No period at the end
- Max 72 characters
- Be specific and descriptive

### Body

** GOOD:**

```text
fix(bookings): prevent double booking

Check availability before creating booking by:

- Querying existing bookings for date range
- Ensuring no overlap with check-in/check-out
- Adding unique constraint on date ranges
- Returning clear error message

This prevents race conditions where two users
could book the same dates simultaneously.

Fixes #156
```text

**L BAD:**

```text
fix: fixed the bug

Made some changes to fix the issue.
```text

**Rules:**

- Explain **why**, not just **what**
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

### Footer

**Use for:**

- Breaking changes
- Issue references
- PR references

**Examples:**

```text
Closes #42
Fixes #123, #456
BREAKING CHANGE: Changed API response format
See: #789
```text

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check Status

```bash

# View changed files

git status

# View diff

git diff
git diff --staged
```text

### Step 2: Group Changes

**Group by logical units:**

- One feature per commit
- One bug fix per commit
- Related changes together

**Example: Instead of one large commit**

```bash

# L BAD: Everything in one commit

git add .
git commit -m "feat: add booking feature"
```text

**Split into logical commits:**

```bash

#  GOOD: Separate commits

# 1. Database schema

git add packages/db/src/schemas/booking/
git commit -m "feat(db): add booking schema

- Define booking table structure
- Add relationships to accommodations and users
- Create indexes for common queries"

# 2. Service layer

git add packages/service-core/src/services/booking/
git commit -m "feat(services): implement booking service

- Add BookingService with CRUD operations
- Implement availability checking
- Add booking validation logic
- Add tests with 95% coverage"

# 3. API routes

git add apps/api/src/routes/bookings/
git commit -m "feat(api): add booking endpoints

- POST /bookings - Create booking
- GET /bookings/:id - Get booking details
- PATCH /bookings/:id - Update booking
- DELETE /bookings/:id - Cancel booking
- Add authentication middleware"

# 4. Frontend UI

git add apps/web/src/components/BookingForm*
git commit -m "feat(web): add booking form component

- Create BookingForm with date selection
- Add guest count selector
- Display pricing breakdown
- Handle form validation
- Show success/error states"

```text

### Step 3: Stage Changes

```bash

# Stage specific files

git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2

# Stage by patch (interactive)

git add -p

# Stage all changes in directory

git add packages/db/

# Stage all changes (use cautiously)

git add .
```text

### Step 4: Write Commit

```bash

# Simple commit

git commit -m "feat(search): add city filter"

# Multi-line commit

git commit -m "feat(search): add city filter

- Add city dropdown to search form
- Filter accommodations by selected city
- Update search results dynamically

Closes #45"

# Or use editor for longer messages

git commit
```text

### Step 5: Verify

```bash

# View last commit

git log -1

# View last commit with diff

git show

# Amend if needed (before pushing)

git commit --amend
```text

## Interactive Commit Helper

### Analyzing Changes

When user requests commit help:

1. **Run git status**

   ```bash
   git status
   git diff --stat
````

2. **Identify changed areas**
   - Backend: API, services, models
   - Frontend: components, pages, hooks
   - Shared: schemas, types, config
   - Infrastructure: CI, deploy, docs

3. **Group related changes**
   - Same feature
   - Same bug fix
   - Same refactoring

4. **Suggest commit messages**

### Example Analysis

**Changed Files:**

````text

packages/service-core/src/services/accommodation/accommodation.service.ts
packages/service-core/src/services/accommodation/accommodation.service.test.ts
apps/api/src/routes/accommodations/search.ts
```text

**Analysis:**

## Best Practices

###  DO

- Write commits in present tense ("add" not "added")
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- Use body to explain **why**, not **what**
- Reference issues in footer
- Group related changes
- Commit frequently (small, logical units)
- Verify changes before committing

### L DON'T

- Commit unrelated changes together
- Use vague messages ("fix stuff", "updates")
- Skip the body for complex changes
- Commit commented-out code
- Commit debug statements
- Commit broken code
- Mix formatting with logic changes

---

## Deliverables

When this skill is applied, produce:

1. **Analyzed Changes** - List of modified files grouped by purpose
2. **Commit Strategy** - How many commits and what each includes
3. **Commit Messages** - Well-formatted conventional commits
4. **Copy-Paste Commands** - Ready-to-use git commands
5. **Issue References** - Linked to relevant issues/PRs

---

**This skill ensures consistent, professional commit history that supports semantic versioning and makes project history easy to understand.**
