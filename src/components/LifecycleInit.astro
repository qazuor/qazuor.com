/**
 * LifecycleInit - Initializes the centralized lifecycle manager

 * This component should be included once in the BaseLayout, before any other
 * scripts that need to use the lifecycle system.
 *
 * It sets up the event listeners for:
 * - DOMContentLoaded (initial page load)
 * - qazuor:content-ready (View Transitions navigation - custom event from ViewTransition)
 * - astro:before-swap (cleanup before navigation)
