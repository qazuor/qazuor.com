  'I had the pleasure to work with Lean when I joined Avature, as Engineering
  Manager. First of all I have to say he was an excellent work colleague,
  helping me to get up to speed with my onboarding with the modules we owned as
  a team. He had a vast experience, and he was the architect and main author of
  the code base we released to production of the strategic portal builder
  feature. He was the most senior developer I had in the team and I had a very
  positive experience with Lean both from the professional and personal point of
  view. I m sure he will continue doing great things in the future!'
