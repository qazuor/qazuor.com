# Skills - Specialized Capabilities

This directory contains skill definitions that provide specialized capabilities
to agents. Skills are reusable expertise modules that can be invoked by multiple
agents when needed.

## What are Skills?

**Skills** are specialized knowledge modules that:

- Provide deep expertise in specific areas
- Can be used by multiple agents
- Contain best practices and methodologies
- Are invoked when specific capabilities are needed

**Difference from Agents:**

- **Agents** are personas with responsibilities and coordination roles
- **Skills** are capabilities/knowledge that agents can use

## 🔍 Testing vs Audit Skills - When to Use Which?

**IMPORTANT:** We have TWO types of quality skills with different purposes:

### Testing Skills (Development - Phase 2)

**Purpose:** Validate code during development using TDD workflow

**Characteristics:**

- Run **frequently** during development
- Part of **TDD cycle** (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Focus on **unit/integration/E2E tests**
- **Quick feedback** (seconds to minutes)
- Executed by **engineers** during coding
- Output: **Test results** (pass/fail, coverage %)

**When to Use:**

- ✅ Writing new code (TDD)
- ✅ Fixing bugs
- ✅ Refactoring
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Before committing code

**Examples:**

- `security-testing` → Test authentication logic, input validation
- `performance-testing` → Benchmark query performance, check response times
- `api-app-testing` → Test API endpoints work correctly

---

### Audit Skills (Formal Review - Phase 3-4)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive formal review before deployment with detailed reports

**Characteristics:**

- Run **periodically** (quarterly, pre-deployment)
- **Comprehensive** multi-area analysis
- Focus on **compliance, standards, best practices**
- **Thorough analysis** (60-90 minutes)
- Coordinated by **tech-lead**
- Output: **Audit reports** with findings, remediation, scores

**When to Use:**

- ✅ Before production deployment
- ✅ Quarterly compliance reviews
- ✅ After major feature launches
- ✅ Before handling sensitive data (PII, payments)
- ✅ When compliance mandates formal audits

**Examples:**

- `security-audit` → OWASP Top 10 compliance, penetration testing simulation,
  formal report
- `performance-audit` → Core Web Vitals, bundle analysis, bottleneck
  identification, optimization roadmap
- `accessibility-audit` → WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance, screen reader testing,
  formal compliance report

### Quick Decision Matrix

| Question       | Testing Skill                 | Audit Skill                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **When?**      | During development (Phase 2)  | Before deployment (Phase 3-4)      |
| **Who?**       | Engineer (TDD workflow)       | tech-lead (coordinates review)     |
| **Frequency?** | Continuous (every commit)     | Periodic (quarterly, pre-deploy)   |
| **Duration?**  | Minutes                       | 60-90 minutes                      |
| **Output?**    | Pass/Fail + Coverage %        | Comprehensive report with findings |
| **Focus?**     | Does the code work correctly? | Does it meet standards/compliance? |

**Rule of Thumb:**

- Building a feature? → Use **testing** skills
- Preparing for deployment? → Use **audit** skills
