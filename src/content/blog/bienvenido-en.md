I'm not here to sell you the framework of the moment or repeat what the official
documentation says. I'm here to share how I work, what problems I solve, and
what I learned by banging my head building real things.

If you got here looking for tutorials on _"how to make a todo-list in React"_,
this probably isn't the place. But if you're interested in seeing how someone
with over 20 years in this field thinks through projects, makes technical
decisions, and sometimes gets it wrong... welcome.

## Who I am

I'm **Leandro Asrilevich**, although online I'm known as **qazuor**. Full-stack
developer with a frontend focus, based in Concepcion del Uruguay, Entre Rios,
Argentina.

My history with web development started over two decades ago. I went through
agencies, personal projects, teaching, and freelance work, but the stage that
marked me the most was at **Avature**, where I spent **19 years** (2006-2025).

### The Avature experience

I joined when Avature was practically a startup. There were few of us, we did
everything, and the hyper-specialized roles of today didn't exist. Over time,
the company grew into a multinational with global presence, and I grew with it.

Some highlights from that stage:

- **2007-2008**: I developed an internal _framework_ in vanilla JavaScript, with
  dynamic dependency loading, _HMR_, _bundling_, _error reporting_ Sentry-style,
  and a component system with lifecycle. All of this before Webpack existed.
- **2012-2017**: I led the **UI Core** team, responsible for the platform's
  _framework_ and UI system. We scaled the team from 2 to 9 people, established
  _code review_ standards, architecture, and _mentoring_.
- **2017-2019**: _Feature Incubation_ as a one-person team. My role was to take
  ideas, bring them to a working MVP, and transfer them to dedicated teams.
- **2019-2025**: **Visual Template Builder**, an internal visual builder like
  Webflow to create portals, email _templates_, and content generated from the
  platform.

Those 19 years taught me to work in large teams with _code reviews_, shared
standards, and technical coordination. But also to move alone when needed,
taking projects from start to finish.

### What I do today

Currently, I dedicate myself to building complete digital products: from the
idea to the _deploy_, including architecture, _frontend_, _backend_,
automations, and everything needed to make something actually work.

I work mainly with **TypeScript**, **React**, **Astro**, **Node.js**, and the
modern JavaScript ecosystem. I also do **No-Code automations** with Make.com for
operational flows where it doesn't make sense to write custom _code_.

Some projects I'm working on:

- [**Hospeda**](/en/projects/hospeda) — Tourism platform for the Argentine
  Litoral, with tools for hosts and AI integration.
- [**Asistia**](https://github.com/qazuor/asistia) — _Multi-tenant_ system of
  conversational AI agents, ready for multiple channels and integrations.
- [**Claude Code Config**](/en/projects/claude-code-config) — CLI to configure
  projects with Claude Code: agents, _skills_, commands, MCP servers.
- [**BookMind**](/en/projects/bookmind) — _Bookmark_ manager with automatic AI
  summaries and semantic search.

## What this blog is about

This is my space to share what I learn while building. It's not a blog of
generic tutorials, it's more of a collection of:

**Real technical decisions** — Why I choose one tool over another, what
_trade-offs_ I consider, and when I get it wrong.

**Architecture and organization** — How I structure projects, _monorepos_,
components, and how I keep _code_ maintainable long-term.

**Modern frontend** — React, Zustand, TanStack Query, TanStack Router, Astro,
and everything I use day to day.

**Pragmatic backend** — Hono, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, REST APIs, and how I
connect everything without creating a Frankenstein.

**AI for devs** — How I use Claude, ChatGPT, and other tools to accelerate my
work without losing control of the _code_.

**Development diaries** — The real process of building products from scratch,
with the problems, decisions, and pivots included.

## What you WON'T find here

_Posts_ written by AI without review or criteria. Tutorials copied from official
documentation. Empty _hype_ about technologies I don't use. Promises of _"master
X in 5 minutes"_.

Everything I write here comes from real experience. If I haven't tried
something, I don't recommend it. If something went wrong, I tell you about it
too.

---

## The tone

I write in Rioplatense Spanish (I'm Argentine), so you'll find voseo, local
expressions, and a pretty direct tone. I don't like corporate content or _posts_
full of _buzzwords_.

I prefer a short _post_ that says something useful over a long one that says
nothing.

I leave technical terminology in English (_code_, _deploy_, _branch_, _testing_)
because that's how we talk among devs and it avoids confusion.

---

## How to navigate the blog

_Posts_ are organized by categories and _tags_. You can filter by topic or just
scroll. Some _posts_ are part of series, like
[**Building Hospeda**](/en/blog?series=construyendo-hospeda) where I document
the process of building a tourism portal from scratch.

You also have a [**Goodies**](/en/goodies) section where I upload tools,
_snippets_, _tricks_, and useful resources I've collected.

## Want to chat?

If you want to talk about a project, have an idea you want to bring to life, or
just want to say hi:

- **GitHub**: [@qazuor](https://github.com/qazuor)
- **LinkedIn**: [Leandro Asrilevich](https://linkedin.com/in/qazuor)
- **Email**: From the [contact section](/en/contact)

And if you're looking for someone to help you build a digital product, design
your project's architecture, or just need a hand with something technical,
[**tell me what you have in mind**](/en/contact). It's always easier to talk
about it than to guess.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you find something useful here.
