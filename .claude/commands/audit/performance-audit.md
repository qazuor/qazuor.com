# Performance Audit Command

## Purpose

Performs a comprehensive performance audit of the application, analyzing
database queries, API response times, frontend rendering performance, bundle
sizes, and identifying optimization opportunities. This command replaces the
deprecated `/review-performance` command with enhanced metrics and actionable
insights.

## When to Use

- **Before Production Deployment**: Ensure performance meets targets
- **After Major Features**: Validate performance impact of new features
- **Performance Regression**: When users report slowness
- **Optimization Cycles**: Regular performance reviews (monthly)
- **Scalability Planning**: Before expected traffic increases

## Usage

```bash
/performance-audit [options]
```

### Options

- `--scope <area>`: Focus audit on specific area (database, api, frontend, all)
- `--profile`: Enable detailed profiling with measurements
- `--report`: Generate detailed performance-audit-report.md
- `--benchmarks`: Compare against performance baselines

### Examples

```bash
/performance-audit                        # Standard full audit
/performance-audit --scope database --profile --report
