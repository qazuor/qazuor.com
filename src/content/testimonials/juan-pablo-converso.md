  'I had the pleasure of working with Leandro at Avature, and I can confidently
  say he is one of those developers who truly make a difference, both for his
  technical excellence and his human quality. Leandro has a deep command of
  JavaScript and the frontend ecosystem, with a rare ability to understand
  complex problems, break them down, and build robust, efficient, and
  maintainable solutions. I consistently saw him approach challenges with strong
  technical judgment, a focus on quality, and a long-term vision, all essential
  qualities in large-scale products. Beyond his technical skills, what truly
  stands out is his attitude. He is always willing to help, share knowledge, and
  contribute in a constructive way. He naturally raises the bar of any team
  through his example, commitment, and way of working. I highly recommend
  Leandro for any JavaScript Developer role. He is a reliable, talented
  professional with a real and lasting impact on the teams and products he works
  with.'

I had the pleasure of working with Leandro at Avature, and I can confidently say
he is one of those developers who truly make a difference, both for his
technical excellence and his human quality.

Leandro has a deep command of JavaScript and the frontend ecosystem, with a rare
ability to understand complex problems, break them down, and build robust,
efficient, and maintainable solutions. I consistently saw him approach
challenges with strong technical judgment, a focus on quality, and a long-term
vision, all essential qualities in large-scale products.

Beyond his technical skills, what truly stands out is his attitude. He is always
willing to help, share knowledge, and contribute in a constructive way. He
naturally raises the bar of any team through his example, commitment, and way of
working.

I highly recommend Leandro for any JavaScript Developer role. He is a reliable,
