# Five Why Command

## Purpose

Root cause analysis using the Five Whys technique to systematically identify
underlying causes of problems, bugs, or architectural decisions. Provides
structured problem-solving approach.

## Usage

````bash
/five-why {problem_description}
```text

## Description

Conducts systematic Five Whys root cause analysis using the `debugger` agent. Iteratively asks "Why?" to drill down from symptoms to root causes, then proposes solutions with tradeoffs for user consideration.

🔍 FIVE WHYS ANALYSIS COMPLETE

Problem: Users experiencing slow search results on accommodation search page

📋 Five Whys Analysis:

❓ Why #1: Why are search results slow?
💡 Answer: Database queries are taking 2-3 seconds to execute
   Context: PostgreSQL query logs show high execution times
   Evidence: Average query time increased from 200ms to 2.8s

❓ Why #2: Why are database queries slow?
💡 Answer: Missing indexes on frequently queried columns
   Context: Query execution plan shows table scans instead of index usage
   Evidence: EXPLAIN ANALYZE shows sequential scans on 100k+ records

❓ Why #3: Why are indexes missing on frequently queried columns?
💡 Answer: Recent schema changes added new search filters without corresponding indexes
   Context: Location and price range filters added without index optimization
   Evidence: Git history shows schema changes without index additions

❓ Why #4: Why weren't indexes added with schema changes?
💡 Answer: Database migration process doesn't include performance review step
   Context: Current process focuses on schema correctness, not performance
   Evidence: Migration checklist lacks index and performance validation

❓ Why #5: Why doesn't migration process include performance review?
💡 Answer: Performance considerations weren't prioritized in development workflow
   Context: Fast development was prioritized over database optimization
   Evidence: No performance testing in CI/CD pipeline

🎯 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
Lack of performance-focused database migration process and performance testing integration

📊 Impact Assessment:

- Severity: High (affects all search operations)
- Scope: All accommodation search functionality
- Users Affected: 100% of search users
- Business Impact: Potential user drop-off due to poor experience

- Reasonable time investment with clear ROI
- Addresses root cause systematically

Next Steps:

1. Implement immediate database indexes
2. Update migration process documentation

## Analysis Techniques

### Systematic Questioning

#### Question Formulation

- **Open-ended Questions**: Avoid yes/no answers
- **Evidence-based**: Ask for concrete evidence
- **Context Gathering**: Understand surrounding circumstances
- **Assumption Challenging**: Question underlying assumptions

#### Common Question Patterns

```text
Technical Analysis:

- Why is [system/component] behaving this way?
- What changed that could cause this behavior?
- Where in the process does the problem manifest?
- When did this problem first appear?

Process Analysis:

- Why wasn't this caught earlier in the process?
- What steps were skipped or inadequate?
- Who was responsible for this validation?
- How did the current process allow this to happen?

System Analysis:

- Why does the system have this limitation?
- What design decisions led to this constraint?
- How does this relate to other system components?
- What assumptions were made during design?

```text

### Evidence Collection

#### Data-Driven Analysis

- **Logs and Metrics**: Concrete evidence from system logs
- **Performance Data**: Quantitative measurements
- **User Reports**: Qualitative feedback and observations
- **Code History**: Git commits and change patterns
- **Configuration Changes**: System and deployment changes

#### Verification Methods

- **Reproduction Steps**: Can the problem be reproduced?
- **Timeline Analysis**: When did the problem start?
- **Impact Measurement**: How widespread is the issue?
- **Correlation Analysis**: What else changed at the same time?

## Common Use Cases

### Bug Investigation

→ Database connection is failing

Why #2: Why is database connection failing?
→ Connection pool is exhausted

Why #3: Why is connection pool exhausted?
→ Connections aren't being properly released

Why #4: Why aren't connections being released?
→ Service methods aren't using try/finally blocks

Why #5: Why aren't proper connection patterns used?
→ No code review checklist for database patterns

Root Cause: Missing database connection management standards

### Performance Issues

→ Multiple API calls block rendering

Why #2: Why are multiple API calls blocking?
→ Sequential API calls instead of parallel

Why #3: Why are calls sequential instead of parallel?

```text

### Architecture Decisions

#### Design Choice Analysis

```text
Problem: Microservices causing deployment complexity

Why #1: Why is deployment complex?
