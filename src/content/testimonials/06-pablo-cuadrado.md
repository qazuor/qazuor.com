Leandro is a Javascript pioneer and architect, which is super important in the
vibe-coding era, as you need true experts that know what happens at a low level.
He knows everything about the web stack and helped me become a better developer
in my Avature days under his tuition. He was using techniques that later became
a signature of libraries like React before they even existed. A super smart guy
and a pleasure to work with.
