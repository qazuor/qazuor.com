 * CalloutEnhancer - Transforms blockquotes with special patterns into styled callouts

 * Detects patterns like:
 * > **Info:** Content here
 * > **Warning:** Be careful...
 * > **Tip:** A useful trick...
 * > **Success:** It worked!
 * > **Error:** Something went wrong
 *
 * And applies the corresponding callout-{type} class for styling.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This component should be included in the BaseLayout to ensure
 * the script is always present and can handle View Transitions navigation.
 * The bundled script runs once and registers a persistent event listener.
